In the given excerpt, which was published in 2007 in the book "Nationalism in Europe 1789-1945" at Cambridge, the contemporary historian Timothy Baycroft describes the impact of Napoleons rule in Europe.
In addition to other historians, this secondary excerpt also targets the interested public.

According to Baycroft, Napoleons conquest was partially motivated by his desire to spread France's political system and partially motivated by his desire to create an European Empire (cf. ll. 2f).
Baycroft believes that, instead of spreading France's political system or creating an Empire, Napoleons' conquest inadvertently caused the growth of nationalist sentiments (cf. ll. 13f).

Several examples for growing Nationalist Sentiments are mentionened afterwards.
Great Britainst growth of National Sentiment was caused by the hardship resulting from Napoleon's continental blockade (cf. ll. 19f).
Italys growth of National Sentiment was also catalysed by this blockade and the suffering resulting from it.
Germanys growth of National sentiment however was mainly caused by the collapse of Prussia and the resulting calls for unity and support by German intelectuals.

Baycroft then goes on to explain, that the development of the Nationalist Sentiments is caused by the embracement of an active minority which wanted to increase this nationalist feeling.

During his reign Napoleon tried spreading France's values accross Europe.
Many countries developed a strong nationalistic feeling after Napoleons reign.

This is because he influenced the European power dynamic in such a way, that it was neccessary for nationalistic tendencies to arise, in order to face the hardships caused by Napoleon.

Napoleon was directly responsible for the reduction of the number of German states because of to the introduction of the Confederation of the Rhine.
Due to the lower amount of Germany states, the opinion of the nationalistic vocal minority could spread more easily and grow more quickly.

Napoleons movements towards a united Italy contributed similiarly to a spread of Nationalistic Sentiments.

Baycrofts main point is, that the aftereffects of Napoleons conquests were mostly in the formation of Nations.
Napoleons conquests directly and indirectly introduced Nationalism to Europes but his conquests left behind many other changes in political and social systems.

Taking into accout all of Napoleons conquest, most introduced some form of Nationalistic Sentiments in the local regions.
Napoleons social and political reforms also paved ways for the vocal minorities to spread their opinions.

All in all Baycrofts main point is a very condensed perspective on Napoleons legacy in Europe.
