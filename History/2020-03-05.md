The Cartoon "Gränzverlegenheit" from 1834 was published in the humorous weekly Magazine "Fliegende Blätter".
The Cartoon is addressed to the readers in the Magazine who are looking for entertainment.
The drawing caricatures the many customs borders in Germany, especially in the time before the founding of the German Customs Union in 1834.

In the cartoon a covered wagon is at two border posts which are very close together and are designated to belong to the border of the principality Lippe-Schauenburg.
Two people are in front of the wagon with one of them being a border guard and the other one talking to him.
The caption reads: "Sie sehen, Herr Gränzwächter, daß ich nix zu verzolle hab', denn was hinte auf'm Wagen ist, hat die Lippi'sche Grenze noch nit überschritten, in der Mitt' is nix, und was vorn drauf is, ist schon wieder über der Lippischen Gränze drüben."

Before 1834 states and principalities withing Germany collected their own taxes and customs.
This lead to high amount of taxation with many different laws because of the way Germany was split up.
Due to the creation of the Customs Union people could trade withing a single market without internal tariffs.
The Principality of Lippe-Schauenburg in Westphalen, which is the one referred to in the cartoon, was one of the smallest German territories during the time of the German Confederation.
