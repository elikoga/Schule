### a)

The Kulturkampf is a conflict of Preussen/the German Empire under Bismarck and the Catholic Church under Pope Pius IX.
Politically it was about splitting the Catholic Church from the State.
While Bismarck was harsh against the catholics, many protestants and liberals criticised him.

### b)

The Sozialistengesetz was a law against socialist and communist gatherings with the intent to overthrow the government.
It was made to oppress socialists and communists.
As a consequence a socialist/communist underground society formed.

The Sozialgesetzgebung were laws by Bismarck to establish a social system to offset the consequences of industrialisation.
While the laws didn't achieve their goals, they laid the groundwork for the future German social system.

### c)

The innere Reichsgründung describes the political developments after 1878 characterized by new laws such as the Sozalistengesetz.

## 2 To what extent can the newly founded German Empire be called a constituational monarchy?

The German Emperor is the head of state and hereditary monarch of the German Empire.
Since the position of German Emperor is given by the constitution of the German Empire and his power is ensured by it, the German Empire may be a constituational monarchy.
The Emperors power is restricted by the constitution.
He has power over the military and appoints the Reichstag and has other responsibilities.
Still, most of the management is done via a democratic process.

# 3 Take a critical stand: Should places/monuments with the name of Bismarck be renamed or replaced?

Bismarck's contributions to German history cannot be neglected.
I believe that places or monuments with Bismarcks name don't have the name to honour Bismarck but to show his mark on German history.
As such I don't believe that Bismarcks name should be removed from the names of places/monuments.
