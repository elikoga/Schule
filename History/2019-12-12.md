The foundation of the German Empire 1871

Why did the war break out?

- Bismarck wanted to form a German national state under Prussian leadership
- France wanted to keep the status quo in Europe and was not willing to accept a strong and powerful German state
- the Prussia ambitions and successes irritated the Frenc, they wanted to stop Prussia from becoming even more powerful
- national feelings in France and in Germany as well contributed to the outbreak of the war
- Bismarck's / Prussia's policy was provoking for the French who then made the mistake to declare war on Prussia, which made the other German states automatically allies of Prussia
