To what extent did the German Confederation fulfill the hopes of those Germans who wanted a united German state?

- disappointment?
- the Confederation was somehow a unity
- some Germans supported the Confederation because of the close aaliance of the German states
- feeling of safety
- there were still borders between the single states - Germany wasn't one united state
- the confederation was a kind of unification
- still too many limitations for the individual
- the Confederation was only seen as the beginning, hopes for a united state grew stronger
- people saw themselves rather as Prussians or Bavarians than as Gemrans - people still felt separated from each other
- for people who wanted a united german state the confederation was seen as a first step
- many people were not quite satisfied but hopeful
