NS Ideology:

The NS-Ideology incorporates Anti-Semitism as one of its main Aspects.
Using Anti-Semitism to paint a group of people - the jews - as the enemy allows skilled propagandists to blame many problems on these people and to merge enemy concepts.
Using the enemy role it is much easier to influence a large group of people to some extent.

The "fertile terrain" that Kershaw mentions is the fact that the Weimar Republic was in a crisis situation with increasing political and social tensions in the population.
Especially the after effects of WW1 are important for that fertile terrain

The Versailles Treaty was felt by many Germans to be unfair.
This fact was used by the NSDAP to gain more support in Germany.
