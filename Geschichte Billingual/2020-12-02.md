1. With the help of the documentary explain the terms: "T채ter, Opfergruppen, Methoden" of the nationalsocialist terror.
2. Summarize in detail (!) who knew what about NS-antisemitism and the Holocaust.

1 T채ter:
- directly involved in the NS-terror, mainly Germans, members of the SS, members of the Wehrmacht, Gestapo, members of serveral deparments of the police, emmbers of the Reichsbahn, high-ranked officials and party members, the government
- the ones who were directly involved, howerer it's difficult to say where direct involvment starts. Still "T채ter" were not only the ones who directly killed Jews but also those who helped to organize the Holocaust. Most people were bystanders ("Mitl채ufer") who knew what was going on and didn't do anything about it
