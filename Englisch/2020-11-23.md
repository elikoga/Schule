Social media usage - chances and dangers

Pros:
- You don't have to explicitly look for content

Cons:
- Takes up time
- Content gets served to you without having to explicitly look for it
- Misinformation
- Societal disruption
- increasing wealth split (by being a big business taking up workers time)
- introduction of attention economy
- foreign state actors get next to direct access into state consciousness
