Dear Matt,

I recently found an article in a German Newspaper about the spanish King and I thought it might concern you because you were working on a Project on Modern Monarchies in Europe.

The articles name is "Der einsame Koenig", so in english "The lonely King", because the King doesn't get any support from his populus.

One of the reasons was that in 2012 when going on a luxurious Safari tour he broke his hip.
He didn't get any support from his populus because on his Safari tour he shot on an Elephant.
He didn't even get any support, he got a lot of backlash from reporters and newspapers.

His family doesn't really behave any better:

His son-in-law for example was sent to jail for 6 years for abuse of public money.

Maybe you want to read a bit more about this article.
The name of the King is "Juan Carlos" and the newspaper I found it in was the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung".

Hope this helps you with your Project.

Regards
Eli
