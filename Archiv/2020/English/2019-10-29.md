# American Dream vs American nightmare
- the term "A.D." usually means living a meaningful, susccessful and satisfying life and implies financial security
- but: the disastrous state of the U.S. economy has turned the A.D. into an American nightmare for millions of jobless epople whose living conditions are getting worse instead of improving
  - many members of the middle-class are slipping into poverty
  - extremely high unemployment rate
  - ever-growing food + energy prices
  - widening gap between rich+poor because the rich stau untouched by the economic + financial crisis and go on profiting from the tax cuts of the Bush era

=> Americans have to rethink their way of life because living the high life at any cost has driven them into desaster
