1. Society:

- mass emigration, especially to America
- German feared a threatening future in Germany
- People hoped for a safer life in Amrica (political freedon: "All men are created equal" / "Pursuit of happiness")
- push factors were more important than pull-factors: People would have wanted to stay in Germany, but left due to political and social reasons.
- the number of emigrants grew steadily. Directly after the failed revolution the number of emigrant increased heavily (738.000 between 1850 and 1854)
- since many Germans wnet to the USA to have a quiet and undisturbet life, amny others followed, which lead to the fact that a strong German community in the USA developed (language, traditions.)


2. Politics:
- "German Dualism": Austria and Prussia as the two biggest German powers had worked together to guarantee peace and stabilty in Germany since the Congress of Vienna 1815. However, the German Revolution had wealemed Austria much more than Prussia, which is why Prussia wanted to strengthen its influence in Germany.
- These plans lead to a conflict between the two states, which could be avoided by a treaty (Ollmuetz, 1850). Still, both powers didn't work together with common interests anymore and their different interests anymore and their different interests became more and more obvious.
- Members of the Prussian government (Bismarck) and the Austrian government as well felt like there could only be ONE major power in Germany in the future
